# Election Algorithms
    1. Many algorithms used in distributed system require a coordinator that performs functions needed by other processes in the system. 
    2. Election algorithms are designed to choose a coordinator. 
    3. Election algorithms choose a process from group of processors to act as a coordinator. 
    4. If the coordinator process crashes due to some reasons, then a new coordinator is elected on other processor.
